Business groups are also referred to as organizations (or sub organizations). Business groups reside within the master organization and can contain their own business groups. The master organization and its business groups are organized in a hierarchical tree, where the master organization is the root. Each business group has one direct parent and can have multiple children.

[NOTE]
Business groups are not enabled by default in a new Anypoint Platform account. To activate business groups in your organization, contact your MuleSoft representative. There is a limit of 100 business groups per organization.

If you are an organization administrator and your organization is enabled for business group support, you can create business groups within your organization. The organization administrator is also the administrator of any business groups (sub organizations) within the parent organization.

[NOTE]
When you create a new business group, all the users with the *Organization Administrators* role in the parent business group are also added as organization administrators in the newly created business group (the child business group). However, when you create a new user as an *Organization Administrator* in the parent business group, the user is not added to all the sub business groups.

=== Create a Business Group

Create business groups within your organization. 

[NOTE]
There is a limit of 100 business groups per organization. 

. In the Anypoint Platform *Access Management* page, in the left menu, click *Organization*.
. Click the blue plus sign next to the organization name or any of the business groups in the tree diagram.

+
. In the dialog box, enter:
  * *Business Group name*: Name for the new business group.
  * *Owner*: Assign an existing user in the organization to be the business group owner.
  * Select *Owner can create Business Groups* to allow the owner to create business groups that branch under this business group.
  * Select *Owner can create environments* to allow the owner to create environments within this business group.
  * You can assign some or all of the vCores that your organization owns to an individual business group. This ensures that these are used by the CloudHub deployments within the business group. You can assign these when creating the business group or edit these settings later.
  * *Static IPs*: Enable the use of static IPs.
. Click *Add Business Group*.

[NOTE]
--
Allocating vCores to a business group makes those vCores available only to that business group, which makes them unavailable to the parent organization.

==== Child Business Groups

You can create hierarchical levels of business groups to provide more control over access. To create a child business group click the blue *+* icon next to any business group.

Since business groups are hierarchical, the owner of a parent business group always retains administrator permissions for any child business group within that parent. This means that the owner of a business group can create child business groups and assign another user as the owner (owners automatically have the Organization Administrators role) of those child business groups, but the owner of the parent group remains an organization administrator. Conversely, owners of child business groups cannot access or modify the parent business group or master organization settings, and cannot view the parent business group's client ID and client secret.

When creating a child business group within a parent, only the vCores that were assigned to the parent business group can be allocated to the child.

=== Navigating Between Business Groups

When your organization has multiple business groups, you can navigate between them using the menu at the top-right corner. Switching between business groups changes the list of available CloudHub deployments, APIs, users, and roles settings.

NOTE]
--
When you sign into Anypoint Platform, you are signed back into the organization or business group you were in when you last signed out.

If you are not an organization administrator, you can view only the business groups that you have permissions to view. In the Organization tab, the tree of your organization displays only the business groups you are a member of.

=== Creating Roles and Handling Membership to Business Groups

Roles can be applied at the master organization level as well as at the business group level. However, each controls different resources. Roles and permissions assigned to a user in one particular business group (or the master org) are independent of the roles and permissions assigned to that same user in other business groups.

To obtain the membership for a business group, you must be granted a role within that business group. Once you are visible in a business group, you can be granted individual permissions in that business group. All users, regardless of which business groups they are in, belong to the master organization and can be assigned individual permissions in the master organization.

Members that are added to a business group can view and access the business group, but to access certain resources, you must have the appropriate roles assigned to you. For example, to access APIs and CloudHub deployments in the business group, you must be assigned roles that belong to that business group. Additionally, roles that belong to a business group can only grant access to APIs and CloudHub deployments within that same business group.

For example, if you have the Organization Administrators role in BusinessGroupA, you can grant users access to APIs and CloudHub deployments in BusinessGroupA. If you also have the Organization Administrators role in BusinessGroupB, this does not mean that you can grant access to APIs and CloudHub deployments in BusinessGroupA to users in BusinessGroupB and vice versa.

Resources that belong to the master organization require roles specified at the master organization level.

Users who are assigned the Organization Administrators role in the master organization, or any business group, are automatically assigned that same role in any child business group created within that business group, so are automatically visible in the child business group. This does not apply to users who are assigned the Organization Administrators role _after_ a child business group has been created.

=== Deleting Business Groups

Only an organization administrator can delete business groups. The master (root) organization can't be deleted, even by an organization administrator.

. In Anypoint Platform Access Management, in the left menu, click *Organization*.
. Click the name of the group to delete.
. In the *Business Group Info* dialog, click *Delete Business Group*.
. In the confirmation dialog, enter the name of the business, then click *Delete*.
